With technology on a steady incline in the year 2022 web design, along with most technology related jobs, is in high demand. 
Web designers transform ideas into digital structured websites and open a world of opportunity for businesses on the web.
Web designers often work closely with clients to better understand exactly what they are looking for and how they want 
their site to feel. Along with programming a large part of the web developer position is often coming up with the design of the  
website and structuring the website on paper before starting at the computer. 

Web designers deal with the “front end” of the website which includes what the user sees and interacts with. Designers use a 
variety of programming languages to do this such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designers often user photoshop and other editing 
software to make mockups for their websites and wireframes. With the internet continuing to rise and online shopping being at 
an all-time high it is expected that by 2024 online shopping sales with reach $365 billion dollars. 
All of these sales depend on websites to support them and provide them with a platform to interact 
with customers. Some careers in the web design field include user interface design, user experience design, web design, 
web development, software engineering, graphic design and many more.
